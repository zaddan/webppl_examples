parameters to set:
br_array: sets the number of rounded bits for the corresponding instruction that it is used for
get_inqueue_from_file: determines whether the input is acquired from a file or generate (almost always should be set to 0)
number_of_repetition: how many times the sampling+calculation(dct calculation) should be repeated

High level overview:
This application calculates the quality associated with a dct function when the instructions
within the dct function are approximated. Approximation is done through rounding. The quality
is measured using SNR. 

Details:
The following step is taken toward the afformentioned goal:
1. a sample from input is generated (inqueue holds the main input)
2. The input is fed through the dct to calculate both inaccurate and accurate results (outqueue)
3. the inaccurate output is resulted through rounding certain instructions.
    -The approximate add is called add_round
    -The approximate multiply is called multiply_round
    -the number of bits rounded is set in the br_array (which sets the number of rounded
        bits for the corresponding instruction that it is used for)
4. the error (for one input) is calculated using the inaccurate and accurate values for 
    that input. Error and accurate values are used to calculate the SNR for one input

5. steps 1 through 4 are repeated and mean and std of SNR is calculated.
